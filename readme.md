#Mockup of Research Project Registration.

Mockup of a research project registration process, just to see what it could be like.

There is no cgi behind these pages, just locally running javascript (borrowed from wikarekare.org's admin pages under MIT lic.). 

* roles.json is a dummy list of Research roles for the "Members" table's select options.
* departments.json is a dummy list of Faculty and Departments, to build the select options from.
* jquery.min.js is a cached copy, so local testing doesn't have to go to the internet.
* www.rb is in repo, just to act as a temporary web server to test the html/js.
